# Day 01 Reflection

**Date:** 26-10-2025

## üå§Ô∏è Wins Today:

* Created my GitHub repo for the challenge as well as the file structure and templates.
* Understand the relationship between local GitHub and the cloud version of GitHub more. 
* Practiced pushing commits from my local machine to the remote GitHub repository.

## üß© Challenges / Friction:

* Never having used GitHub locally it took some learning and patience as I first didn't rename my README files correctly but I got some help from ChatGPT. 

## ‚ö° Insight or Lesson:

* Windows by default hides file extensions by default. To change this go to the folder with the wrong file > View > Show > File name extensions. Then you can rename a file with the correct file extension e.g. README.md.txt (incorrect) to README.md (correct).
* How to update a *single GitHub file*:

cd path/to/Cyber75Hard        # Navigate to your repo

git pull                      # Get latest changes from GitHub

git add Reflections/Day01.md  # Stage your updated file

git commit -m "Day 01: Updated reflection notes"

git push                       # Send changes to GitHub



* How to update multiple specific files:

cd path/to/Cyber75Hard

git pull

git add Labs/Day01\_LabName/lab\_notes.md Reflections/Day01.md

git commit -m "Day 01: Added lab and reflection notes"

git push



* How to update everything

cd path/to/Cyber75Hard

git pull

git add .                      # Stage all changes

git commit -m "Day 01: Added all updates"

git push
