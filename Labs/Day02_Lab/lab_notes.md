# Day 02 Lab: Programmatic Remediation in Linux

# **Date:** 27-10-2025

## Objective

Using Bash scripts to programmatically remediate vulnerabilities on a Linux machine.

## Steps Completed

1. Created Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu Server 22).
2. Run an authenticated baseline scan of the Linux machine.
3. Introduce vulnerabilities by installing Telnet and setting the Root password to 'root'.
4. Run another authenticated scan to observe the vulnerabilities picked up by the scan.
5. Remediate vulnerabilities using Bash scripts
6. Run final scan showing vulnerabilities remediated.

## Key Learnings

* Pipe commands in Bash script - used to programmatically remediate insecure root password

## Notes / Observations

* Running Tenable scans on Linux machines takes substantially less time than on Windows machines. 

## Next Steps

Do some more practice with Bash scripting.
